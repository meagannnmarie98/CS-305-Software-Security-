Portfolio 
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artermis financial, is my client who is a company who specializes in custom software design and development for entrepenuers, businesses, and government agencies around the world. It was my job to make sure that "security is everyones responsibilty" I was assigned to be the agile scrum for global rain. Artemis financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. The main goal was for me to make sure that they have top of the line security and that the software we were creating was secure for the users and all of their personal data. To detect the software security issues we ran the software and debugged it accordingly due to their security needs. We ran multiple maven checks so we knew all of the vulnerabilities and which lines of the code we needed to check so the software ran securely for Artemis Financial and all of their clients. It is very important to code securely because if you do not we are putting ourselves at risk for hacking and our personal data being compromised. Security adds value to our company and our overall wellbeing by giving us a good reputation and it keeps us from encountering unnecessary data breaches and issues we can avoid before they happen. Working through the vulnerability assessment I found it very helpful because it gave me confidence in my code and how secure it was. 




What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
